.. code-block:: bash
    py .


* Method 2 (while out of the root dir but is accessible in the current location and assuming root dir is "Passwords")

.. code-block:: bash
    py Passwords


If you wish to execute the ``Passwords.py`` located in scripts dir under root dir use the following command

.. code-block:: bash
    py path\to\Passwords.py

.. code-block:: bash
    path\to\Passwords.exe

dir can be added into environmental variable paths
